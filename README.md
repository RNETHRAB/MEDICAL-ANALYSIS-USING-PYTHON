# MEDICAL-ANALYSIS-USING-PYTHON
Conducted an end-to-end analysis of patient medical records (1,000 entries) to extract actionable health insights using Python and statistical visualization.

•	Project Overview: Conducted an end-to-end analysis of patient medical records (1,000 entries) to extract actionable health insights using Python and statistical visualization.

•	Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.

•	Key Contributions:

o	Preprocessed and explored structured medical data using Pandas for data cleaning and summarization.

o	Performed statistical analysis (mean, std, quantiles) to understand trends across age, weight, height, and blood pressure by disease categories.

o	Created interactive visualizations and plots (box, violin, distribution) using Seaborn and Plotly to highlight disease-wise age and pressure distributions.

o	Used grouping and filtering to isolate patients with Stroke and compared clinical metrics across seven disease categories for comparative analysis.

•	Insights:

o	Identified Stroke patients had a slightly lower average age than the overall population.

o	Visualized potential outliers and patterns in age distribution that could guide clinical decision support and personalized medicine initiatives.

•	Outcome: Delivered clear, data-driven insights and visual dashboards to support real-world medical applications like disease tracking, patient risk profiling, and health monitoring.
